      INVOICES
      <p>
        Just a note to keep in mind... When a quote is CONVERTED to an invoide,
        it's hidden from the quotes page, and a duplicate is created and
        converted to an invoice. So you can still show the old linked quote on
        the invoice single page if wanted.
      </p>
    </div>
